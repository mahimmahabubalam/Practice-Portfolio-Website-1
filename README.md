# Practice-Portfolio-Website-1
This project is for learning purposes only.  
The design and structure are based on a YouTube tutorial, and I do not claim original ownership of the design.

A practice portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. I tried to replicate a modern portfolio design, experiment with animations, and improve my frontend skills. I made mistakes, learned from them, and continue working to master web development—this project is part of that journey.
